give me code for event UserRegistered anbd listener SendWelcomeEmail in laravel with full code


1 / 1

Sure! Here's an example of how you can define an event called `UserRegistered` and a listener called `SendWelcomeEmail` in Laravel.

First, create a new event using the following command in your terminal:

```
php artisan make:event UserRegistered
```

This will generate a new file called `UserRegistered.php` in the `app/Events` directory. Open that file and modify it as follows:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Events;

use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Events\Dispatchable;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;

class UserRegistered
{
    use Dispatchable, SerializesModels;

    public $user;

    /**
     * Create a new event instance.
     *
     * @param  User  $user
     * @return void
     */
    public function __construct(User $user)
    {
        $this->user = $user;
    }
}

```

Next, create a new listener using the following command in your terminal:

```
php artisan make:listener SendWelcomeEmail --event=UserRegistered

```

This will generate a new file called `SendWelcomeEmail.php` in the `app/Listeners` directory. Open that file and modify it as follows:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Listeners;

use App\Events\UserRegistered;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;

class SendWelcomeEmail implements ShouldQueue
{
    /**
     * Handle the event.
     *
     * @param  UserRegistered  $event
     * @return void
     */
    public function handle(UserRegistered $event)
    {
        // Send the welcome email to the registered user
        // You can access the user model using $event->user

         \Log::info('MyEvent occurred', ['data' => $event->user])
    }
}

```

Note that we implemented the `ShouldQueue` interface to make the listener run asynchronously in the background, which can be useful for sending emails. If you don't want to use the queue, you can remove the `ShouldQueue` interface and the `use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;` statement.

Once you've created the event and listener, you need to register the listener in Laravel's event service provider. Open the `app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php` file and add the following code to the `listen` array:

```php
protected $listen = [
    UserRegistered::class => [
        SendWelcomeEmail::class,
    ],
];

```

Finally, you can fire the `UserRegistered` event from your code wherever a new user is registered. For example, in your user registration controller, you can add the following line after successfully creating the user:

```php
event(new UserRegistered($user));

```

That's it! Now, whenever a `UserRegistered` event is fired, the `SendWelcomeEmail` listener will be triggered, and you can define the logic to send the welcome email inside the `handle` method of the listener.

give me code for trigger event in user model with boot and $dispatchesEvents for above code


1 / 1

Certainly! To trigger the `UserRegistered` event in the `User` model using the `boot` method and the `$dispatchesEvents` property, follow the steps below:

1.  Open the `User` model, which is typically located in `app/Models/User.php`.
2.  Add the following import statements at the top of the file:

```php
use App\Events\UserRegistered;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

```

3.  Modify the `User` model class to include the `HasFactory` trait and the `$dispatchesEvents` property. Also, add the `boot` method as follows:

```php
class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasFactory;

    // ...

    /**
     * The event map for the model.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $dispatchesEvents = [
        'created' => UserRegistered::class,
    ];

    // or use Boot method

    /**
     * Boot the model.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    protected static function boot()
    {
        parent::boot();

        static::created(function ($user) {
            event(new UserRegistered($user));
        });
    }

    // ...
}

```

In the `$dispatchesEvents` property, we map the `created` event of the `User` model to the `UserRegistered` event. This means that whenever a new user is created, the `UserRegistered` event will automatically be fired.

Inside the `boot` method, we define a closure that is executed when a user is created. Within this closure, we manually fire the `UserRegistered` event, passing the newly created user as an argument to the event.

With these changes, whenever a new user is created, the `UserRegistered` event will be triggered automatically, and any registered listeners will be notified.

Please note that the `$dispatchesEvents` property requires Laravel 8 or higher. If you're using an earlier version of Laravel, you can remove the `$dispatchesEvents` property and solely rely on the `boot` method to manually fire the event.
