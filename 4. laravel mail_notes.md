give me code for laravel mail

Certainly! Here's an example code for sending an email using Laravel's built-in mailing system:

First, make sure you have configured your email settings in the `.env` file of your Laravel project. You'll need to set the `MAIL_MAILER`, `MAIL_HOST`, `MAIL_PORT`, `MAIL_USERNAME`, `MAIL_PASSWORD`, and `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` variables according to your email provider's configuration.

Next, create a new mailable class using the following command:

```
php artisan make:mail SendEmail

```

This will generate a new file `app/Mail/SendEmail.php`. Open the file and update it with the following code:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Mail;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Mail\Mailable;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;

class SendEmail extends Mailable
{
    use Queueable, SerializesModels;

    public $message;

    /**
     * Create a new message instance.
     *
     * @param  string  $message
     * @return void
     */
    public function __construct($message)
    {
        $this->message = $message;
    }

    /**
     * Build the message.
     *
     * @return $this
     */
    public function build()
    {
        return $this->subject('Example Email')
                    ->view('emails.send');
    }
}

```

In the code above, we defined a new mailable class `SendEmail` that accepts a message parameter in the constructor. The `build` method is used to define the subject of the email and the view file to be rendered (`emails.send` in this case).

Next, create a new Blade view file for the email. Create a file named `send.blade.php` in the `resources/views/emails` directory and add your email content, for example:

```blade
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Email</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Example Email</h1>
    <p>{{ $message }}</p>
</body>
</html>

```

Now, you can use the `SendEmail` mailable class to send emails from anywhere in your application. Here's an example of how you can send an email in a controller:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Mail\SendEmail;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;

class EmailController extends Controller
{
    public function sendEmail(Request $request)
    {
        $message = $request->input('message');

        Mail::to('recipient@example.com')->send(new SendEmail($message));

        return response()->json(['message' => 'Email sent successfully']);
    }
}

```

In the above example, we use the `Mail` facade to send the email. We pass the recipient's email address and the `SendEmail` mailable instance to the `to` and `send` methods, respectively.

Remember to replace `'recipient@example.com'` with the actual recipient's email address.

That's it! You now have a basic setup for sending emails using Laravel's mailing system.
