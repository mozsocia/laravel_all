In Laravel, `url()` and `route()` are two helper functions used to generate URLs in your application.

`url()` generates an absolute URL, meaning it includes the full domain name, while `route()` generates a relative URL based on the named route.

For example, if you have a named route defined as follows:

```php
Route::get('user/{id}', 'UserController@show')->name('user.show');

```

You can generate the URL for this route using the `route()` helper:

```php
$url = route('user.show', ['id' => 1]);

```

This will return a relative URL like `/user/1`.

On the other hand, the `url()` helper can be used to generate an absolute URL, for example:

```php
$url = url('user/1');

```

This will return an absolute URL like `http://your-app.com/user/1`.

In general, you should use `route()` whenever possible as it allows you to change the URL structure of your application without affecting the code that generates the URLs. However, there may be situations where you need to generate an absolute URL, for example, when sending an email or redirecting to an external URL.

What should be used in laravel blade

In Laravel Blade templates, it's recommended to use the `route()` helper function for generating URLs, instead of the `url()` helper function. This is because using `route()` allows you to define your routes in a central location (i.e., `routes/web.php` or `routes/api.php`), making it easier to maintain and change the URLs of your application in the future.

For example, if you have a named route defined as follows:

```php
Route::get('user/{id}', 'UserController@show')->name('user.show');

```

You can generate the URL for this route in your Blade template using the `route()` helper:

```php
<a href="{{ route('user.show', ['id' => $user->id]) }}">Show User </a>

```

This way, if you ever need to change the URL structure of your application, you can do so in the `routes/web.php` or `routes/api.php` file, and the change will be reflected throughout your application.
