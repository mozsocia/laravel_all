Sure, here's an example of how you might use DTOs to transfer data between the business logic layer and the presentation layer in a Laravel application:

1.  In the `app` directory, create a new directory called `DTO`.
2.  In the `DTO` directory, create a new file called `OrderDTO.php`.
3.  The `OrderDTO.php` file should contain the following code:

```php
<?php

namespace App\DTO;

class OrderDTO
{
    public $id;
    public $customer_name;
    public $total_price;
    public $status;
    public $created_at;
}

```

This defines a new DTO class called `OrderDTO` with properties for an `id`, `customer_name`, `total_price`, `status`, and `created_at`.

4.  Now you can use this DTO class in your application's business logic layer to transfer data to the presentation layer. For example, in your `OrderService.php` you can use `OrderDTO` like this:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Services;

use App\DTO\OrderDTO;
use App\Order;

class OrderService
{
    public function getOrderDetails($id)
    {
        $order = Order::find($id);
        $orderDTO = new OrderDTO();
        $orderDTO->id = $order->id;
        $orderDTO->customer_name = $order->customer->name;
        $orderDTO->total_price = $order->total_price;
        $orderDTO->status = $order->status;
        $orderDTO->created_at = $order->created_at;

        return $orderDTO;
    }
}

```

This `OrderService` class has a method `getOrderDetails` that finds an order by id and returns an `OrderDTO` object, which contains the order's details like id, customer\_name, total\_price, status, and created\_at.

Now you can use this `OrderDTO` object in your controller to pass the data to the presentation layer.

```php
class OrderController extends Controller
{
    public function show($id)
    {
        $orderService = new OrderService();
        $orderDTO = $orderService->getOrderDetails($id);
        return view('orders.show', compact('orderDTO'));
    }
}

```

It will pass the order details in the `orderDTO` object to the view `orders.show`.

In this example, the `OrderDTO` class is used to transfer data from the `OrderService` to the `OrderController` and then passed to the view. This way, you can ensure that the data passed to the view is in a consistent format and only contains the data that is needed in the view.

You can also use this DTOs in other parts of application where you want to pass data, like passing data from the business logic to the API layer.

This is a basic example, but you can also add methods or properties to the DTO, or create other DTOs for different parts of the application, depending on your needs.
